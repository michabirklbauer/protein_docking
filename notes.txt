(Rough) Summary:
Calculating most important amino acid interactions in protein dockings.

When docking two things are important:
* How well does molecule fit
* Which interactions are there
First aspect is not enough as a small molecule would almost get a very good fit. Goal is
to compute a score of both aspects -> some interactions are more important than others ->
find those.
