Hydrogen Bonds

A hydrogen bond between a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor is reported if several geometric requirements are fulfilled. 
The distance has to be less than HBOND_DIST_MAX and the angle at the donor group (D-H...A) above HBOND_DON_ANGLE_MIN.

Since salt bridges involve purely electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds, it is not meaningful to report 
both interaction types between the same groups. Thus, hydrogen bonds between atoms are removed if they belong to groups 
that already form a salt bridge to that atom.

As a general rule, a hydrogen bond donor can take part in only one hydrogen bond, while acceptor atoms can be partners 
in multiple hydrogen bonds (e.g. bifurcated hydrogen bonds). For multiple possible hydrogen bonds from one donor, only 
the contact with the donor angle closer to 180 ° is kept.

Water bridges

While residues can be bridged by more than one water molecule, for the prediction in this script the only case considered 
is one water molecule bridging ligand and protein atoms via hydrogen bonding.

The water molecule has to be positioned between hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pairs of ligand and protein with distances of 
the water oxygen within WATER_BRIDGE_MINDIST and WATER_BRIDGE_MAXDIST to the corresponding polar atoms of the donor or acceptor 
groups. If a constellation with a water atom fulfils these requirements, two angles are checked. The angle ω between the acceptor 
atom, the water oxygen and donor hydrogen has to be within WATER_BRIDGE_OMEGA_MIN and WATER_BRIDGE_OMEGA_MAX.Additionally, the 
angle θ between the water oxygen, the donor hydrogen and the donor atom has to be larger than WATER_BRIDGE_THETA_MIN.

Similar to standard hydrogen bonds, a water molecule is only allowed to participate as donor in two hydrogen bonds (two hydrogen 
atoms as donors). In the case of more than two possible hydrogen bonds for a water molecule as donor, only the two contacts with 
a water angle closest to 110° are kept
